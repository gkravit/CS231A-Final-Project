# CS231A-Final-Project
Contains video output and rough Hough Circle python code used in initial pose estimation exploration.  Unfortunately, ran out of time due to difficulty with compiling CAFFE  and GOTURN project [github.com/davheld/GOTURN] on to the NVIDIA TX1 [https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/blob/master/docs/building-nvcaffe.md]
